    <p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unite of discourse. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p>
    <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up into units of <b>text</b>. For example, a book may have chapters. <i>Chapters can have subheadings. Under each heading there will be one or more paragraphs.</p>

      <p>This is how we make a word appear <i>italic</i>.

  <p>It's a potato <i>Solanum teberosum</i>.</p>
  <p>Captain Cook sailed to Australia on the
  <i>Endeavour</i>.</p>
